The examples below are adapted to be used with CVP 2018.2.3 or higher.
They will fail on lower versions of CVP due to the change in scripting
architecture for configletbuilders where jsonrpclib class was replaced
with Device class.

See configlet builders below as an example, skeleton to build from.
Feel free to adapt them after own needs in own environment.
