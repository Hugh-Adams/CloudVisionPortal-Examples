# Arista CloudVision&reg; Portal Configlet Builder Examples
I often refer to this as CVP Scripting 101.  It introduces users to the concept of configlets and configlet builders and where portions of switch configurations belong.  Static parameters that are consistent across the entire network or a large subset of devices should be included in the BasicStatic.  BasicBuilder is a short script that configures variables unique to each device such as hostname, management interface, ip address, description and VRF. If VRFs are utilized it also creates the VRF, assigns a management interface to the VRF and enables the management api in the appropriate VRF.

In approximately 100 lines of code, users get an ntroduction to libraries, functions, forms,  labels, global and local variables, variable substitution, regex and json.  A short introduction to the advantages of an Extensible Operating System (EOS) and power of Python scripting.
