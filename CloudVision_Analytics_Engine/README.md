# Arista CloudVision&reg; Analytic Engine RESTful API Examples
This directory contains scripts that use the CloudVision Analytics
Engine (CVAE).

## Rest_API

The advantage of CVAE is that it streams the telemetry data to the consumer of
that data so that polling is not required.  Even so, there are still legacy
applications that require polling to get specific telemetry data.  Instead of
polling all the switches you can poll CVAE to get the data you need. This
directory contains examples of using the CVAE RESTfulAPI.

## hbase

This directory contains scripts for working with hbase.
