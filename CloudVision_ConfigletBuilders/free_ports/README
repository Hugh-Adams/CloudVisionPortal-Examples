This script is to check a switch for free ports and report back to the user as a configlet.   It is more of a eAPI exercise to run commands on a switch and parsing the results rather than a configlet builder to build out or configure a network.  

It could be used alternatively as a tool to show or teach python/eAPI to users, kind of like the W3Schools try it yourself function. The generate function will give a visual result of what you are creating in the edit window on the Built Configlet window. 

Directions
Once you've imported this configlet, you will have 3 fields to enter before you can use this script. Enter the username, password, and IP address of a switch -- then click Generate. The right window will shown an output of free ports and its status in the past 5 minutes.
