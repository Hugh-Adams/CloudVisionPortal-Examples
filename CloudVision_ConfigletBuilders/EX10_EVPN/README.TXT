The examples below are adapted to be used with CVP 2019.1.0 or higher.
They will fail on lower versions of CVP due to the change in scripting
architecture for configletbuilders where jsonrpclib class was replaced
with Device class.

The configlet builders are also optimised to use the CLI changes introduced
in EOS-4.23.x, but is backwards compatible with EOS-4.21.x and EOS-4.22.x.

See configlet builders below as an example, skeleton to build from.
Feel free to adapt them after own needs in own environment.
